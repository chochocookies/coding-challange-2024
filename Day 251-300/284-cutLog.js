// Description:
// CLEAR CUTTER'S NEEDS YOUR HELP!
// The logging company Clear Cutter's makes its money by optimizing the price-to-length of each log they cut before selling them. An example of one of their price tables is included:

// # So a price table p
// p = [ 0,  1,  5,  8,  9, 10]

// # Can be imagined as:
// # length i | 0  1  2  3  4  5 *in feet*
// # price pi | 0  1  5  8  9 10 *in money*
// They hired an intern last summer to create a recursive function for them to easily calculate the most profitable price for a log of length n using price table p as follows:

// function cutLog(p, n) {
//   if (n == 0) return 0;
//   let q = -1;
//   for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
//     q = Math.max(q, p[i] + cutLog(p, n - i));
//   }
//   return q;
// }
// An example of the working code:

// However, their senior software engineer realized that the number of recursive calls in the function gives it an awful running time of 2^n (as this function iterates through ALL 2^n-1 possibilities for a log of length n).

// Having discovered this problem just as you've arrived for your internship, he responsibly delegates the issue to you.

// Using the power of Stack Overflow and Google, he wants you to create a solution that runs in Î˜(n^2) time so that it doesn't take 5 hours to calculate the optimal price for a log of size 50. (He also suggests to research the problem using the keywords in the tags)

// (Be aware that if your algorithm is not efficient, it will attempt to look at 2^49 = 562949953421312 nodes instead of 49^2 = 2401... The solution will automatically fail if it takes longer than 6 seconds... which occurs at right around Log 23)

// Your new function as given to you by me, your boss.
var cutLog = function(p, n) {
    // Array to store the maximum prices for lengths from 0 to n
    let dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);

    // Fill the dp array
    for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
        let maxPrice = -1; // Initialize max price for length j
        for (let i = 1; i <= j; i++) { // Iterate over all possible first cuts
            maxPrice = Math.max(maxPrice, p[i] + dp[j - i]); // Update max price
        }
        dp[j] = maxPrice; // Store the best price for length j
    }

    return dp[n]; // Return the maximum price for length n
};

// Example usage
let p = [0, 1, 5, 8, 9, 10]; // Price table
let n = 5; // Length of the log
console.log(cutLog(p, n)); // Output: 10


//other solutions
const cutLog = (p, n, cache = {}, q = Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY ) => {
  if (n == 0) return 0;  
  if (cache[n]) return cache[n];  
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) q = Math.max(q, p[i] + cutLog(p, n - i, cache));
  return cache[n] = q;
